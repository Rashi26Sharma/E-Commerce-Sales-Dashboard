### 🛒 E-commerce Sales Dashboard

A visually compelling, interactive Power BI report to monitor and analyze online sales performance across customer segments, product categories, and key KPIs—designed for actionable insights in a competitive e-commerce environment.

### 📌 Short Description / Purpose

The E-commerce Sales Dashboard is built to help businesses track sales trends, customer behavior, and profitability metrics across different regions, categories, and months. It empowers decision-makers to drive data-backed marketing, inventory, and sales strategies.

### 🧰 Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• 📊 **Power BI Desktop** – Core platform for data modeling and visualization
• 🔄 **Power Query Editor** – Data cleaning and transformation
• 🧠 **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Dynamic KPIs, time intelligence, and conditional formatting
• 🧩 **Data Modeling** – Star schema with fact and dimension tables for scalable insights
• 📁 **File Format** – `.pbit` (Power BI Template) for easy replication and personalization

### 📊 Data Source

This template uses mock or structured data typical to e-commerce businesses:

* Order ID, Product ID, Customer ID
* Order Date, Ship Date
* Sales, Profit, Quantity
* Customer segment, Region, Product Category/Sub-category

🔹 **Data Type**: Cleaned transactional e-commerce sales data
🔹 **Simulated for dashboard design**, can be replaced with real business data via data load
